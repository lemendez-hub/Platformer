/*
 * This script is responsible for reading a level layout from a text file and constructing the level
 * in a Unity scene by instantiating block GameObjects. The level file should be placed in the
 * Resources folder, and each line in the file represents a row of blocks.
 *
 * WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
 * 1. In the for loop that iterates over each character (i.e. letter) in the current row, determine
 *    which type of block to create based on the letter (e.g., use 'R' for rock, 'B' for brick, etc.).
 *
 * 2. Instantiate the correct prefab (rockPrefab, brickPrefab, questionBoxPrefab, stonePrefab) corresponding
 *    to the letter.
 *
 * 3. Calculate the position for the new block GameObject using the current row and column index.
 *    - You will likely need to maintain a separate column counter as you iterate through the characters.
 *
 * 4. Set the instantiated block’s parent to 'environmentRoot' to keep the hierarchy organized.
 *
 * ADDITIONAL NOTES:
 * - The level reloads when the player presses the 'R' key, which clears all blocks under levelRoot
 *   and then re-parses the level file.
 * - Ensure that the level file's name (without the extension) matches the 'filename' variable.
 *
 * By completing these TODOs, you will enable the level parser to dynamically create and position
 * the blocks based on the level file data.
